After putting all my possessions into the loft at the end of October once we insulated and floored the roof space all my items are now mouldy (after being in the loft less than 6 weeks!!!) as no ventilation was fitted when the new roof was installed. Stewart continues to ignore my calls and I\u0027ve had no option but to rectify the problems using another company!

They stated that they were a long established and reliable company and all work came with a 10 year guarantee and they were just a phone call away. A price and starting date was agreed. I was extremely disappointed with the quality of the workmanship, but agreed to pay as i was assured my concers regarding work carried would be rectified. This was never done,to my dismay when it rained the roof leaked. They have returned on 3 occasions but still the roof leaks ,they have since agreed to repair the roof on 3 separate dates but not to appear. L,since this they no longers answer my phone calls or messages i suspect that my phone number has been blocked.

Look further than Roof Shield Ayrshire","reviewBody":"Roofshield Ayrshire offers Professional Service Guaranteed. Or so says the advert.\nIf you are searching for a roofer to carry out roof repairs you would be wise to swerve from Roofshield Ayrshire.\nRoofshiel Ayrshire in his flyer makes several statements which in my experience are false.\nHe says: \u0022we offer a professional, honest and reliable roofing service\u0022 but I found that none of the three claims hold water.\nOver the course of the dealings with the firm the owner kept asking me to make sure That I wrote a review about my experience with him. Well, here it is and I hope he is happy.\n\nReliable? The job was started 2 days later than planned. The job took longer than estimated due to the staffing level and quality.\nSupervision was almost nonexistent \nProfessiona? In the latter part of the job and also after it was finished he failed to answer various communications in the form of texts, email, telephone and postal. Some of these communications regarded payments which he has never confirmed as received. Another (via recorded delivery) was about a very unprofessional piece of work regarding an extractor duct. This communication was not acknowledged, replied to or acted upon. Several were about demanding a presence as his visits to the site were extremely low. On more than one occasion he was not seen at all the whole day. Some of his personnel ability was highly suspect. Considering the age and doubtful experience of an operator, he was left on his own and unsupervised for a whole day while working with ladders and scaffolding. The firm\u0027s safety practices were unsafe. Including having this young person working on his own with ladders and scaffolding, in another occasion a supposedly fully trained operator left a ladder at the end of the working day fully extended and erected on an area where children under 10 years were playing.\nThe owner\u0027s supervision was wholly faulty. When I phoned him regarding this ladder he said that he would ask the workman to return and make the ladder safe. This didn\u0027t happen but the owner failed to check back with me resulting in the ladder being left unsafe overnight. Allegedly he fired the workman but the firm\u0027s owner took no responsibility over his part in the inappropriate response in the safety issue.\nHonest? throughout the duration of the work he kept repeating \u0022trust me, trust me\u0022 yet, apart from the safety issue, leaving aside the amount and quality of the work force, lack of supervision and overseers the owner failed to satisfy me on at least to points of honesty \n1 - Before the work started I made a new agreement with the owner to include repairs to the walls. I asked him to carry out 4 repairs including installing a vent duct for an extractor. He pointed out several other cracks and suggested that he got them fixed as well as painting the walls. A new price was agreed, slightly high but I accepted it. In the event the one crack and two bricks missing were fixed. I saw no evidence of any other cracks being checked or filled in any way but using the wall paint as a quick fix instead.\n2 - The vent duct for the extractor installation amply evidences the  professionalism and honesty of the firm\u0027s owner.\nWhen the workman went to install the duct, he had brought a 4\u0022 duct conduit where a 6\u0022 was required. The owner said that he would come back with a 6\u0022 duct next day. False. His workman came back next day. He told me that they could not get a 6\u0022 duct and proceeded to fix the 4\u0022 duct using tape as a fixing. After a search in the internet I sent the owner a recorded delivery letter with 4 links to firms that advertised 6\u0022 ducts and their fixings at great prices. I asked on the letter to send someone on the 9th of July to install the right parts. I have seen nobody or had a reply. That is professionalism and honesty for you. \nDocuments and pictures are available. \nYou engage Roofshield Ayrshire at your peril.\nHe did make a comment to a letter I sent him with the above content “Some people are never happy” Nice.\n While, I pray that I will be waterproof come winter","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","bestRating":"5","worstRating":"1","ratingValue":"2"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Trustpilot","sameAs":"https://www.trustpilot.com"},"inLanguage":"en"}]},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Dataset","name":"Roofers Ayrshire - Roof Shield Ayrshire Ltd","description":"Bar chart review and ratings distribution for Roofers Ayrshire - Roof Shield Ayrshire Ltd, provided by Trustpilot.","publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Trustpilot","sameAs":"https://www.trustpilot.com"},"mainEntity":{"@type":"csvw:Table","csvw:tableSchema":{"csvw:columns":[{"csvw:name":"1 star","csvw:datatype":"integer","csvw:cells":[{"csvw:value":"4","csvw:notes":["67%"]}]},{"csvw:name":"2 stars","csvw:datatype":"integer","csvw:cells":[{"csvw:value":"1","csvw:notes":["17%"]}]},{"csvw:name":"3 stars","csvw:datatype":"integer","csvw:cells":[{"csvw:value":"0","csvw:notes":["0%"]}]},{"csvw:name":"4 stars","csvw:datatype":"integer","csvw:cells":[{"csvw:value":"0","csvw:notes":["0%"]}]},{"csvw:name":"5 stars","csvw:datatype":"integer","csvw:cells":[{"csvw:value":"1","csvw:notes":["17%"]}]},{"csvw:name":"Total","csvw:datatype":"integer","csvw:cells":[{"csvw:value":"6","csvw:notes":["100%"]}]}]}}}]

            <p class="review-content__text">
                Fed up with the unfinished job, poor workmanship and professionalism. Trims fell off within 24 hours of payment. Gutters have fallen off and garage has been flooded due to this. The list is endless. No receipt for payment given despite numerous requests. Ignoring refund requests despite going through small claims court. Staff were working in unsupervised and unsafe conditions. If he said TRUST ME once it got boring! Do not trust this company. This is going to cost me a lot of money to rectify all the problems.
